# WinMainMaze
This is a 3-dimensional sokoban game for windows made with OpenGL and the WinMain functionality found in winbase.h  

WinMain is the conventional name used for the application entry point.  WinMain should initialize the application, display its main window, and enter a message retrieval-and-dispatch loop that is the top-level control structure for the remainder of the application's execution. This is a 3-dimensional maze game based on this framework.
