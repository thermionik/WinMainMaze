# WinMainMaze  

Thanks to all this project's contributors! dr0ptpacket, 0ctothorpe, and da r0b0h0b0.

This is a 3-dimensional sokoban game for windows made with OpenGL and the WinMain functionality found in winbase.h  

WinMain initializes the application, displays its main window, and enters a message retrieval-and-dispatch loop that is the top-level control structure for the remainder of the application's execution. This program is heavily reliant on this framework.

# Bugs and features:
There is a working particle explosion effect, that can be placed into the world and will animate over and over.
The gun does not actually shoot yet.
This is a pretty old project, who knows what I'll do with it.
