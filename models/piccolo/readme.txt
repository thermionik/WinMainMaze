Model description       : Sent to planet Earth when his homeworld Namek was about to be hit by a comet, Kami-Sama created the Dragonballs on the new world. He wanted to be pure good and so he purged his evil and 'impure' side. Unfortunately, his evil thoughts formed into Piccolo-Daimao. They have a spiritual link, so if one of the two dies, both of them die. Piccolo is the sole offspring of Piccolo-Daimao. Like his father, his intentions are evil. However, when a greater evil, Raditz, threatens the Earth, he turns to the side of good and helps Goku. Piccolo later trains Goku's son, Gohan, to prepare for a greater battle. And thanks to Gohan, Piccolo become a good, well-meaning person. Capable of regenerating body parts and manipulating his size and shape, Piccolo is a formidable fighter. (edited from character bios of Kami-Sama and Piccolo on planetnamek.com)
