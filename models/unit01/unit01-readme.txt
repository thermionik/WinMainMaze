Model description       : Super-Deformed version of the Evangelion Unit01 from Neon Genesis Evangelion
			  
Other info              : The model, like all Evas, is to be considered female in gender(Sexy, too!).

Thanks to              	: This would not have been possible without the original vision 
			  provided by Gainax.

			  Thanks to the Quake Community, Id software.
			  Those jerks @ Sunstorm Interactive, Especially Npherno and his wonderful coding 
		   	  and MrRogers for his youthful enthusiasm and input.
                          A big thanks to all those involved with the Q2pmp.  Without all of the
			  response the site has gotten, I doubt the model would have seen the light of day.

* Play Information *

New Sounds              : <YES> The current sounds are to be considered temporary. r13 had paid another model author to do sounds for the model. However, at the release date he's still not seen them. So for a quick fix, he whipped up some pitch shifted sounds based on the standard id sounds. They do the trick of extending the mood of the character, but little else. New sounds one way or another should be coming in the future.

CTF Skins               : <NO>  We just couldn't get to that as well. If any skin authors are interested in doing some, we'd be more than happy to look at some quick sketches on the skin. We'd rather you don't do the entire set and present us with them.  If we don't like them, we may not endorse them and they might become wasted efforts. Obviously the red one is done, but we're senstive to how the other colors are portrayed.  If we are presented with a set that do the trick, we'll repackage the model with them.

VWEP Support            : <NO>  It could be concievably done, but not today.


* Construction *

Vert Count		: 398
Mapping Vert Count	: 333
Poly Count              : 710
Skin Count              : one
Skin Size		: 256x256
Skin Waste		: 24%

Editors used            : Initial model created by Thump in Autocad R14 one face at a time!
				Further tweaked in Qme, Quake 2 Model Editor, and 3D Studio 							
				Max (Whew!)

			  The skin was painted one pixel at a time with various versions 
				of Npherno's Skin Tool (thanx so much N, It's still the
 				only way to fly!) with minor use of Corel Photo Paint.

			  Animated By R13 In 3D Studio Max 2.5 and Character Studio 2.1

Known Bugs              : Again the shoulder is the issue.  This time its a bit different. I've figured out Charcater Studio's vert system and was able to keep the shoulder from rotating into the shoulder guards. However the shoulder guard does a few wacky things on the back side. Looks like i misassigned a vert or two.  Live and learn. Guess its a good thing I don't get paid for this.

Build/Animation time    : One Entire Mother Fucking Year.


* Author's Notes *

r13-    I'm really happy with this one. We saved him to the last as we knew we would be learning things along the way and I didn't want to learn more while doing this one.  I cranked out the animations on this one in about 3 days. I owe everything to Character Studio. By using the bip files from the other two evas, I always had a place to start and improve on.  But these are far from professional quality animations.  I'm just a armchair modeler and animator and after going over these guys the last time before putting them out the door, I realize just how far I do have to go.  Good thing I really like doing this stuff.  Thanks again to all who've helped.

Thump-  Once again, the same body with a new head and skin. Bit more polys in the chest this time. The nonsequential order of the model's release is due to the order of construction. I began with Asuka's Unit 02 since i enjoyed the design of it more than Rei's eva, and saved Shinji's for last since it had always been my favorite. Still not uterly pleased with the head and chest, but they are very much done. 
	This by no means is the end of our plans for Super-D 'vangelion PMP's. I hope the next round can have some working jaws (I wish I had been able to do this with shinji, but maybe next time). I hope you have as much fun fragging him as I had creating him (it won't take much!   8D )
